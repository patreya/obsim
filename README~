Summary
This software contain two parts. The first part generates a list of sources (position, observing duration, priority) and saves those that are visible from the given location to a input file.

The second part of the code uses the information from the input file and computes a schedule for the observation night. The current algorithm chooses the highest priority source that is observable. 

The platform is built such that multiple algorithm can be built, and can be compared for the efficiency of the observation


Assumptions/Drawbacks	
(1) Only one night of observation is assumed
(2) Correction for change of position of sources during slew not taken into account 
(3) Detail testing has not been performed

Example:
patreya > python obsim.py 
Using schedule by priority algorithm for 515 sources
From total of 515 sources,  53 sources is scheduled for observation
Total slew time is 0.27 hour
Total observing duration is 11.73 hour
Median value of priority for the entire source is 48.90
Median value of priority for the scheduled source is 92.30
